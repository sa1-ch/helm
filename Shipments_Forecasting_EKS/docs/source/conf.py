# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import os
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join("..", "..")))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = "ts_forecast"
# copyright = '2019, Tiger Analytics'
author = "Tiger Analytics"


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
    "sphinx.ext.coverage",
    "sphinx.ext.napoleon",

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = "alabaster"

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
html_static_path = ["_static"]


# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"

# Theme options are theme-specific and customize the look and feel of a theme
# further.  For a list of options available for each theme, see the
# documentation.
html_theme_options = {"logo_only": True}

# Add any paths that contain custom themes here, relative to this directory.
# html_theme_path = []

# The name for this set of Sphinx documents.
# "<project> v<release> documentation" by default.
# html_title = 'zarr v@@'

# A shorter title for the navigation bar.  Default is the same as html_title.

# The name of an image file (relative to this directory) to place at the top
# of the sidebar.
